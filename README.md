_Model trained on the the detection of forgery in artworks via the means of ML._

**ABSTRACT:** This project aims at the identification of art paintings by using machine learning. In today's world,
computers are advancing faster than ever and more and more applications of machine learning have been explored, like
computer vision. We have identified this problem statement as relevant and challenging. Currently, the detection of forgery
in museums is done by examining the painting in detail by an art expert. Ongoing research on automated art
identification is limited. Through machine learning, we aim to identify if two paintings are painted by the same person.
We believe that our proposed solution for detecting forgery in art paintings hold interesting applications for curators
and art historians, and for connoisseurs and art lovers. Through our project, the similarity between different artists
can be found out, with the characteristics and style of their paintings identified through machine learning.
