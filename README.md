_Model trained on the the detection of forgery in artworks via the means of ML._

**ABSTRACT:** This project aims to accurately determine the authenticity of famous art paintings around the globe by using machine learning. In today's world,
the exponentially accelerated expansion of computational notions and their endless potential, alongside which an increasing number of unexplored machine learning applications are unravelled, we have identified this problem statement as relevant and challenging. Currently, the detection of forgery or replicas in museums is done by examining the painting in fine-detail by an expert curator. Ongoing research on automated art-piece identification is limited. Through machine learning, we aim to identify if two paintings are painted by the same person, and thus verify their genuineness. We believe that our proposed solution for detecting forgery in art paintings holds interesting applications for curators, art historians, connoisseurs and art lovers. Through our project, not only can forgery be detected, but also the subtle similarities and variations between different artists can be found out, through the characteristics and style of their paintings identified via machine learning.
